# Problem Set 7

In this problem set, you will build applications using the React framework. Note:

- Because these exercises are more involved, I suggest your **read the entire set of instructions** before starting the project. 
- You must run `npm install` both in the _root directory_ (i.e., `ps-6`) **and** in each exercise repository (i.e., `ps-7/exercise-1`). This is because the projects were initialized with `create-react-app`

## Checking Your Work
This problem set comes with a suite of _unit tests_ that you can use to check your work and understanding. Tests are **not** guaranteed to be comprehensive.

In order to run these tests, you will need to have the [Jest](https://facebook.github.io/jest/) test runner installed **globally**. You will also need to install the test dependencies listed in the `package.json` file:

```bash
npm install # install local packages for unit testing
```

You can run these tests by using the `jest` command from the repo's root directory, specifying the problem to test as an argument:

```bash
# run tests for exercise-1
jest exercise-1

# run tests for all problems
jest
```
